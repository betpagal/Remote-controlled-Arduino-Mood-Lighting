# Remote-controlled-Arduino-Mood-Lighting
Combine a close-out LED light strip with a tiny Arduino Pro Mini board, add remote control and you have a cheap, versatile mood lighting setup. Full instructions at https://www.instructables.com/id/Remote-controlled-Arduino-Mood-Lighting/

My bedroom light is on the ceiling. It's nice and bright, which is good when it's time to clean or put clothes away, but when it's time for bed, it's a bit harsh.

I wanted a soft light that would provide enough illumination to keep from stubbing my toes, but would be more appropriate for nighttime activities. And mood lighting may also enhance certain other shared bedtime activities.

A while back, while visiting my doomed Radio Shack (RIP), I ran across a meter-long LED strip that was on sale for under $10. I thought this would be a nice basis for an Arduino-based mood-lighting project so I bought all they had. As the project progressed, it had to have automation, so I added remote control capabilities using a spare remote and a $2 IR receiver. Finally, a small speaker was added to provide feedback to know when a button on the remote was pressed.

To save space, I used an Arduino Pro Mini (about ten bucks) and put the whole thing in a mint tin.
